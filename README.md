# Bayesian Topic Segmentation

This repository includes the code and experiments for exploring a Bayesian-based unsupervised topic segmentation method.  
It's based on the 2008 research paper by **Jacob Eisenstein** and **Regina Barzilay**.

The goal is to automatically divide text into meaningful topic sections **without using any labeled data**.
